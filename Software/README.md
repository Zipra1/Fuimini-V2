This folder contains the device files to build your own firmware for the trackers.
Make sure to put `pm_static_fuiminiv2_uf2_nrf52833.yml` in the root of the SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF.
The contents of `board` go into `SlimeVR-Tracker-nRF/boards/make-a-new-folder-here/`
You should then be able to select `fuiminiv2_uf2` when building the firmware.
